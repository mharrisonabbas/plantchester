            <p class="paragraph">Manchester has long been a city of radical change, championing social justice and equality. Known as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, it also ignited movements for workers’ rights, suffrage, and socialism. Figures like Friedrich Engels and the rise of the trade unions laid the groundwork for challenging societal inequalities.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Today, this spirit of activism lives on in the city’s vegan movement. Much like the socialists of the past, modern-day vegans challenge the status quo, advocating for ethical, sustainable choices that protect animals, people, and the planet. Veganism addresses systemic issues like climate change, food justice, and animal exploitation, echoing Manchester’s historic fight for fairness.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By choosing plant-based lifestyles, Mancunians continue to push boundaries, blending the city’s radical past with its progressive future—one meal at a time.</p>
